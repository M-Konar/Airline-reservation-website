#Project Title#: Zeyad Tyara air travel agecy  website.

It's a website for Those who love travelling and adventure!
- As a user you can book you can view all the available flights with all the search filters that helps you find the flight that suits you the best.
- You can book the flight online, cancel it, ..etc (the user part is not implemented yet in sprint 1.)
 
- As an Admin, you can create new flights, view all the available flights using filters to search among them, edit available flights and delete them with ease simply by pressing on buttons that exist on the flight cards. 
- All changes done by the admin are reflected instantaneously on the backend and the DB.
 The website is implemeted using the MERN stack( Mern stands for MongoDB- Express- React- NodeJS) and the DB is hosted on the cloud using MongoDB free plan.   


Motivation: 
The project was created as instructed in the Advanced Computer Lap course. We, frankly speaking, did it for the grades :D, but also to have fun and test our self-learning and programming skills as future computer engineers. 

Build Status:The Project is working perfectly without any errors


Code Style:The Model-View-Controller style was used in the project's backend side. Their is a folder dedicated for each category(Model-View-Controller) for each category of users.




Screenshots:Search for your desired flight from the homepage directly.
