Motivation: 
The project was created as instructed in the Advanced Computer Lap course. We, frankly speaking, did it for the grades :D, but also to have fun and test our self-learning and programming skills as future computer engineers. 

Build Status:The Project is working perfectly without any errors


Code Style:The Model-View-Controller style was used in the project's backend side. Their is a folder dedicated for each category(Model-View-Controller) for each category of users.
